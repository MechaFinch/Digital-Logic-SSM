# Digital Logic SSM
 A Simple Stack Machine made with Digital (https://github.com/hneemann/Digital)  
  
The general idea is to minimize the chips necessary to breadboard it.  
Current chips required (as of first commit):
 - 2x somethingk x 8 RAM
 - 2x 4k x 8 EEPROM
 - 6x 8 bit register w/ clock enable (2x & 2x 16 bit)
 - 3x 8 bit presettable counter (1x & 1x 16 bit)
 - 2x 8 bit tri state
 - 2x 8 bit 4 to 1 multiplexer (1x 16 bit, 4x 4 bit)
 - some kind of 555 clock setup
  
ISA and such is TBA, draw wires first code later lol
